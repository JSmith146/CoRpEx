# Section 1 - Basic Information

## 1.1 Name: CoRpEx

## 1.2 Summary: 
CoRpEx is a package designed for the exploration and mining of large textual corpuses of documents.

## 1.3 Description
  The CoRpEx package is designed for novice R users who require the ability to manuever through large corpuses of textual documents to discover contextual insight. This package will provide users with the ability to effectively and efficiently explore these large textual data corpuses through the utilization of various exploratory text mining techniques. Techniques used in this package consist of methods to visualize components of a corpus (corp plot and keyword search), methods to reduce and specfiy the size of the corpus (topic subset and date isolation), methods to manipulate the content of the corpus (merge terms), and methods to provide visualizations of text mining analysis (term association, topic modeling, n-gram analysis, and bigram and correlation network analysis). T Implementation of this package will require that users have a robust data frame in which, at a minimum, columns are identified for the document Id, date, and text data.

  Users will have the ability to explore corpuses through the application of various text mining statistical techniques such as n-gram analysis, term frequency analysis, term correlation analysis, and topic modeling. This package will build upon multiple existing R text mining packages including `tm`, `topicmodels`, `quanteda`, and `ldatuning` to name a few. Other packages used in this package provide functionality for data structure, i.e. `tidyr`, and base level code used for execution, i.e. `tidyverse`, `widyr`,and `tidytext`. Visualization packages used include `ggplot`, `igraph`, and `ggraph`.

##1.4 Access
  Users will access this analytic product through either the use of impletementing the package or through the use of the online R shiny application.

##1.5 Security Concerns
  Users will upload their own corpuses. Any security concerns will be the reponsibilty of the user who uploaded data.

##1.6 Design Constraints
  This package requires no appearance/design constraints

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Info_Table <- read_excel("~/Learning R/OPER 782/Info_Table.xlsx")
# pander::pander(Info_Table)
kable(Info_Table)
