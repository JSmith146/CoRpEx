Description: The CorpEx package is designed for novice R users who require the 
             ability to manuever through large corpuses of textual documents. 
             This package will provide users with the ability to effectively and efficiently 
             explore these large textual data corpuses through the utilization of various 
             exploratory text mining techniques.This package will also allow users the ability to 
             manipulate the content of the corpus by creating, merging, separating, and deleting terms 
             found within a corpus. Additionally, this package will provide visualizations to users 
             during their exploratory navigation through each corpus. Implementation of this package will 
             require that users have a robust data frame with, at a minimum, columns identified for the 
             document Id, date, and text data.
